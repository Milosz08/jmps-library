# Java MultiPurpose Spring Library

NOTE:
This library is still in pre-alpha testing stage. When the full version is released, it will be available on maven central.

To use the library without a remote maven repository, clone that repository and call publishToMavenLocal via Gradle IntellijIdea tab. NOTE: I am not responsible for any damages resulting from using the library in pre-alpha version.
